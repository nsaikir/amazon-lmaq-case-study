Translating business requirements into technical specifications in AWS involves a structured process that bridges the gap between what 
stakeholders need (“the business requirements”) and how those needs are implemented technically in Amazon Web Services (“the technical 
specifications”). Here’s a step-by-step explanation tailored for a Business Analyst role in a data/analytics context like Last Mile 
Analytics at Amazon:

1. Gather and Clarify Business Requirements
Meet with stakeholders (operations, product, engineering teams, etc.) to understand their goals, pain points, and desired outcomes.
Document business use cases — e.g., “We want to reduce average delivery route time by 5%” or “We need to identify map data anomalies 
impacting driver navigation.”
Clarify KPIs and success criteria — What metrics will determine if the solution works? (e.g., delivery time, data accuracy, driver satisfaction)
2. Analyze Data Sources and AWS Environment
Identify relevant data sources (e.g., navigation data in Amazon Redshift, operational logs in S3, real-time data streams in Kinesis).
Assess current data pipelines and AWS services — ETL jobs (Glue, Lambda), Data Warehouses (Redshift), Visualization tools (QuickSight), etc.
3. Define Technical Specifications
For each business requirement, translate it into actionable, technical details:

A. Data Ingestion & Storage

Requirement Example: “We need to analyze driver delivery routes.”
Technical Spec: Configure AWS Glue jobs to extract raw route data from S3, process and load into Redshift for analytics.
B. Data Processing & Transformation

Requirement: “Detect anomalies in map data.”
Technical Spec: Develop Python scripts (in Lambda or Glue) to process Redshift/S3 data, apply validation logic, and flag anomalies.
C. Data Quality & Validation

Requirement: “Ensure map data accuracy >99%.”
Technical Spec: Implement automated data quality checks using AWS Glue jobs; store results in DynamoDB or Redshift; trigger alerts via SNS
if failures occur.
D. Reporting & Visualization

Requirement: “Provide weekly dashboards for route efficiency.”
Technical Spec: Build Tableau dashboards using data from Redshift or use AWS QuickSight to create and share interactive reports.
E. Automation & Scheduling

Requirement: “Automate daily data refresh.”
Technical Spec: Schedule ETL jobs in AWS Glue or Data Pipeline; use CloudWatch Events for orchestration.
4. Specify Security, Access, and Compliance
Define IAM roles and policies for data access.
Specify encryption (at-rest/in-transit) for S3/Redshift.
Document audit and logging requirements (e.g., CloudTrail, S3 access logs).
5. Write Clear Documentation
Use structured templates (Business Requirements Document, Functional Specs, Data Flow Diagrams).
Detail data fields, sources, transformation logic, error handling, and reporting needs.
Provide acceptance criteria and test scenarios.
6. Review and Iterate
Review technical specifications with engineering and stakeholders.
Refine specs based on feasibility, cost, and feedback.
Ensure alignment between business goals and AWS implementation.
Example Table:

Business Requirement	Technical Specification (AWS)
Track driver delays in real-time	Stream GPS updates via Kinesis, process with Lambda, store aggregated data in Redshift
Detect map data inconsistencies	Use Glue ETL to validate new map data in S3, log issues to DynamoDB, alert on SNS
Visualize weekly delivery performance	Build QuickSight dashboards pulling data from Redshift
Summary:
Translating business requirements into AWS technical specifications means breaking business goals into actionable AWS architecture and processes (data flows, ETL, storage, analytics, reporting, security), and documenting everything clearly so that engineering teams can build, automate, and maintain the solutions effectively.
