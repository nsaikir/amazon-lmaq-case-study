a STAR-format example for “Handle and analyze large-scale navigation datasets, map datasets and map attributes” 
for the Amazon Last Mile Analytics & Quality Business Analyst position:

Situation:
At my previous organization, we aimed to improve the accuracy of our last mile delivery routes, but inconsistencies 
in our navigation and map datasets led to frequent delivery delays and suboptimal driver experiences.

Task:
I was tasked with handling and analyzing large-scale navigation datasets (over 50 million records) to identify data 
discrepancies, optimize route mapping, and enhance overall delivery efficiency.

Action:
Leveraged SQL and Python to ingest, clean, and process multiple sources of navigation and mapping data, including GPS traces, 
map attributes, and delivery records.

Automated ETL pipelines to integrate and standardize map features like road segments, turn restrictions, and delivery points.

Implemented data validation checks to identify and correct inaccurate map attributes, collaborating with engineering teams to validate changes.

Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize route efficiency trends and monitor the impact of data corrections.

Result:
Through these efforts, data quality issues were reduced by 35%, leading to a 12% improvement in estimated delivery time accuracy
and a measurable increase in driver satisfaction scores. Our process became a model for other teams within the organization.
