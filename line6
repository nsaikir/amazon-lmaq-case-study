To perform statistical analysis and create predictive models in AWS, you can leverage a combination of AWS services and common analytics tools. Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored to the context of a Business Analyst role in LMAQ Maps, focusing on large-scale navigation and mapping datasets:

1. Data Ingestion and Storage
Amazon S3: Store large volumes of raw and processed data (e.g., navigation logs, map datasets) in scalable, secure object storage.
AWS Glue/Athena: Use AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean, process, and catalog your data; use Athena to query data directly in S3 using SQL.
2. Data Exploration and Statistical Analysis
Amazon Redshift: Load cleaned data into Redshift, a fully managed data warehouse, for fast SQL-based analytics on large datasets.
Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks: Use Jupyter notebooks in SageMaker, where you can write Python or R code to:
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (Python) or dplyr, ggplot2 (R).
Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis).
Use built-in or custom libraries for more advanced statistical modeling.
3. Building Predictive Models
Amazon SageMaker: This is AWS’s fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, you can:
Prepare data (built-in data wrangling).
Train models using built-in algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Learner, Random Cut Forest) or bring your own code (Python/R/Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch).
Tune models automatically (hyperparameter optimization).
Deploy models as APIs for real-time or batch predictions.
Example workflow:
Prepare Data: Use SageMaker Data Wrangler or Jupyter notebooks in Studio.
Feature Engineering: Create new features, normalize/standardize data.
Train Model: Use SageMaker built-in algorithms or your custom script.
Evaluate Performance: Check metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, AUC, etc.
Deploy Model: Create an endpoint for predictions, or run batch transform jobs for bulk scoring.
4. Visualization and Reporting
Amazon QuickSight: Connect to S3, Redshift, or SageMaker endpoints to visualize results, build dashboards, and share insights.
Integration with Tableau/PowerBI: Export processed data and predictions to be visualized in familiar BI tools.
5. Automation & Orchestration
AWS Glue/SageMaker Pipelines: Schedule and automate ETL, model training, and deployment workflows.
AWS Lambda: For lightweight, event-driven automation (e.g., trigger model retraining when new data arrives).
Example: Predicting Delivery Delays
Ingest data: Store delivery logs and route data in S3.
Clean/process: Use Glue to process and join map attributes with delivery outcomes.
Statistical analysis: Analyze correlations between map features and delivery times in SageMaker Studio.
Model building: Use SageMaker to train a model (e.g., XGBoost) predicting likelihood of delay based on route, time, and map features.
Deploy & monitor: Deploy the model via SageMaker endpoint, visualize predictions and trends in QuickSight/Tableau.
Iterate: Continuously update models with new data, automate retraining using SageMaker Pipelines.
