Below are sample scenarios and example analyses for the responsibility:
"Analyze complex business problems and develop data-driven solutions using SQL, Python, or R"
These examples are tailored for the Last Mile Analytics & Quality context at Amazon.

Sample Scenario 1: Route Delay Analysis
Business Problem
Delivery routes experience frequent delays, impacting customer satisfaction. The goal is to identify the root causes of delays using historical delivery data.

Data Sources
Delivery route logs (timestamps, locations, driver IDs)
Traffic data
Weather data

Sample Solution (SQL + Python)
SQL Example: Extracting Delayed Deliveries

SQL
SELECT route_id, driver_id, scheduled_time, actual_time, 
       (actual_time - scheduled_time) AS delay_minutes, traffic_condition, weather_condition
FROM delivery_logs
WHERE (actual_time - scheduled_time) > 10;
Python Example: Analyzing and Visualizing Delays

Python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data from SQL query
df = pd.read_sql(query, connection)

# Analyze delay by traffic and weather conditions
delay_summary = df.groupby(['traffic_condition', 'weather_condition'])['delay_minutes'].mean().reset_index()

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
for traffic in delay_summary['traffic_condition'].unique():
    subset = delay_summary[delay_summary['traffic_condition'] == traffic]
    plt.bar(subset['weather_condition'], subset['delay_minutes'], label=traffic)
plt.xlabel('Weather Condition')
plt.ylabel('Average Delay (minutes)')
plt.title('Average Delivery Delay by Traffic and Weather')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Business Insight:
Delivery delays are highest during "Heavy" traffic and "Rainy" weather.
Recommend dynamic routing or additional buffer time for such conditions.

Sample Scenario 2: Identifying Inefficient Delivery Zones
Business Problem
Some geographic zones consistently underperform in delivery speed. Identify these zones and propose optimization strategies.

Data Sources
Delivery completion times by zone
Zone attributes (urban/rural, distance from depot)

Sample Solution (R Example)
R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assume delivery_data is loaded with columns: zone, completion_time, zone_type, distance_to_depot
zone_stats <- delivery_data %>%
  group_by(zone, zone_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_time = mean(completion_time), .groups='drop')

# Visualize
ggplot(zone_stats, aes(x=distance_to_depot, y=avg_time, color=zone_type)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title='Average Delivery Time vs Distance to Depot',
       x='Distance to Depot (km)', y='Average Delivery Time (min)')

Business Insight:
Rural zones farthest from the depot have the slowest deliveries.
Suggest opening micro-depots or optimizing delivery schedules for these zones.

Summary of Approach:
Define the business question clearly.
Extract and clean relevant data using SQL.
Use Python/R for in-depth analysis and visualization.
Present actionable insights and recommend solutions.
